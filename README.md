# Big-Data-Computing-Homeworks
Homeworks developed for the course Big Data Computing, University of Padua. All implementations use Apache Spark and are written in Java.

## HW1
Count the (approximate) number of triangles in a graph using mapReduce, comparing spark partitions and node coloring.

## HW2
Count the (approximate and eact) number of triangles in a graph using different numbers of partitions and executors.

## HW3
Calculate the number of distinct items and their frequency (count-sketch estimation) in a given interval, received as an unbounded stream of data.
